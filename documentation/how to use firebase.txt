    You're about to initialize a Firebase project in this directory:

    C:\Users\faizan alam\OneDrive\Documents\CodoFile-Firebase\Codo-File\frontend

    ? Are you ready to proceed? Yes

    === Project Setup

    First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
    You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add,
    but for now we'll just set up a default project.

    ? Please select an option: Use an existing project
    ? Select a default Firebase project for this directory: codofile-85b0c (codofile)
    i  Using project codofile-85b0c (codofile)

    === Hosting Setup

    Your public directory is the folder (relative to your project directory) that
    will contain Hosting assets to be uploaded with firebase deploy. If you
    have a build process for your assets, use your build's output directory.

    ? What do you want to use as your public directory? build
    ? Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? Yes
    ? Set up automatic builds and deploys with GitHub? No
    ? File build/index.html already exists. Overwrite? No
    i  Skipping write of build/index.html

    === Functions Setup
    Let's create a new codebase for your functions.
    A directory corresponding to the codebase will be created in your project
    with sample code pre-configured.

    See https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/organize-functions for
    more information on organizing your functions using codebases.

    Functions can be deployed with firebase deploy.
